From the Prediction,  "carpet is the surface where Robot uses acceleration and velocity"


navigate a robot using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors).
help robots recognize the floor surface they’re standing 
collected IMU sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. 
The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data 
such as acceleration and velocity. 
 improve the navigation of robots without assistance across many different surfaces, so they won’t fall down on the job.
